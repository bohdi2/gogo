This is a game I wrote years ago. The idea is simple: you have a pile of cards and you have to
remove the topmost cards. The tricky part is I wanted to have piles in excess of a million cards.
I never got much higher than 100,000 cards because I kept everything in memory.

At large numbers of cards the trivial/obvious algorithms don't work at all.
